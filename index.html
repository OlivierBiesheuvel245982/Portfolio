            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a student at Breda University of Applied Sciences, pursuing a degree in Applied Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. I have a strong interest in AI, data analytics, and how these technologies can be applied to solve real-world problems. Throughout my studies, I’ve developed skills in machine learning, data visualization, and automation.

                I’m always looking to expand my knowledge and apply it in innovative ways, with a focus on creating practical solutions through data-driven insights. This portfolio showcases some of the projects I’ve worked on during my academic journey.</p>

                    <p>This project explores the portrayal of artificial intelligence in the movie Chappie (2015) and its relevance to real-world AI concepts. Chappie tells the story of an AI-powered robot that gains consciousness, raising questions about the nature of AI, machine learning, and sentience. The project analyzes the film’s depiction of AI within the context of modern AI technologies, discussing how close we are to achieving such advanced capabilities. Ethical concerns around AI development, autonomy, and control are also highlighted. This project provides a critical evaluation of the feasibility of AI like Chappie in today's world.</p>
